cabal-version:       1.12
name:                alpaca-netcode
version:             0.1.0.0
synopsis:            Rollback/replay NetCode for realtime, deterministic, multiplayer games.
description:
  A rollback/replay client-server system for realtime multiplayer games. The API
  only requires you to express your game as a pure, deterministic function.
  .
  See "Alpaca.NetCode" to get started.
  .
  === Advantages
  * Simple code. Your game logic contains no NetCode.
  * Low bandwidth. Only inputs are shared.
  * Zero latency. Player's own inputs affect their game immediatly.
  * UDP based. Unordered and using redundancy to mitigate packet loss.
  * Lightweight server. The server does not run the game logic, it only relays and tracks user inputs.
  * Cheating. Only inputs are shared which eliminates a whole class state manipulation cheats.
  .
  === Disadvantages
  * Increased CPU usage. Rollback/replay means that clients must run the game step function multiple times per frame.
  * Not suitable for large numbers of players. Tens of players is likey reasonable.
  .
  === Disclaimer
  This is an initial release with minimal functionality and still very
  experimental. Use at your own risk.
